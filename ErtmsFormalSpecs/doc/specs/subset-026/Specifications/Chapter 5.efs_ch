>Procedures: A procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems and components) to either information exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or events (triggered by external entities or internal events).

When a transition refers to a driver&apos;s selection, it means that the conditions to enable the corresponding button on the DMI were fulfilled.

1. Driver selects Non Leading.
2. Train is at standstill.
3. The &quot;non leading&quot; input signal is received.
But what happens if Start of Mission is in the state S10, the driver selects Non Leading, but no &quot;non leading&quot; input signal is received?</Comment>
If the driver selects NL (E10) then the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to Non Leading mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transition between modes: transition [46]). The mission starts in NL mode.<Sub>

<Comment>The Paragraph 5.6.4.3 describes a degraded situation where no order to terminate the communication session was received from the RBC after a given number of position report sendings. It states that in that case the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall terminate the session. But there is no information about the state change after this action =&gt; should be process end? or remain in the same state?</Comment>
After a defined number of repetitions (see appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value Data), and if no reply is received within the fixed waiting time from the last sending of the mode change report, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall terminate the session.</Paragraph></Sub>

When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an On Sight area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the driver.</Paragraph><Paragraph

>Note: In an On Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of the supervised train is free. Therefore, if the next block section is free, the RBC has nevertheless to ensure that there is no train/vehicle between the train and the end of the On Sight area. This information
	- can be given to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means (outside scope of ERTMS/ETCS), or
	- can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends a &quot;track ahead free&quot; request which the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment displays to the driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the current section, the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment will transmit this information to the RBC.</Paragraph><Paragraph

When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Limited Supervision area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the driver.</Paragraph><Paragraph
